# Noita XML Visualizer
Visualizes the `worldpixelscenes.xml` file in the save files of the game [Noita](https://noitagame.com/).

It was made when the community was still figuring everything out the game had to offer. This application made me the first person to find **The Moon**.

It is a simple and small program but it shows that I can make good use of comments and can handle errors.
